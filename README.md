<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
This Project is a Rails app built using Ruby on Rails, to implement the creation of forms both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides. We have created a User Controller that contains the new, create, edit and update methods, along with its routes and corresponding forms inside the Views.
